# Mocha CoffeeScript Boilerplate

A minimalistic boilerplate for a CoffeeScript project that is tested with [visionmedia/mocha](https://mochajs.org/).
Requires Node.js to run unit tests.

For a more extensive demo of Mocha's featureset, take a look at [ryu22e/mocha-example](https://github.com/ryu22e/mocha-example).

## Usage

1. `rm -rf .git`
1. `npm install .`
1. `make test`
1. Replace `example.coffee` in both `test` and `src` with your own code.
1. Edit `Readme.md`, `package.json`, and `index.js`, replacing this project's details with your own.
1. `make clean build test`
